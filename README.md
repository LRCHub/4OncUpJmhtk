[00:00.73] I've been meaning to call, it's okay if you hate me
[00:07.86] How's it like back at home? Is the lake still as pretty?
[00:15.45] I see that we've been running around
[00:17.99] In these peculiar towns, different coastlines
[00:22.83] And we've been way too busy, it's cool
[00:25.13] It's nice to see we're still fools in the same light
[00:51.13] 
[00:30.84] When the odds of it all get in the way
[00:36.71] Know I'll be around when you call at the end of the day
[00:44.18] Even if the world around you feels like it's all falling apart
[00:49.27] There'll forever be a room for you inside of my heart
[00:52.83] It's true, there's always room for you
[01:11.83] 
[00:59.23] The time that you ran it was almost 10:30 (PM)
[01:06.83] You just get out of bed, you must've woken up early
[01:15.01] Remember that old house down the road
[01:17.10] With the window you broke?
[01:18.72] Well they tore it down (down, down, down, down)
[01:21.83] And though the city started to change
[01:24.48] It still remembers your name, like how I do now
[01:47.98] 
[01:29.45] When the odds of it all get in the way
[01:35.62] Know I'll be around when you call at the end of the day
[01:43.03] Even if the world around you feels like it's all falling apart
[01:48.39] There'll forever be a room for you inside of my heart
[01:52.09] It's true, there's always room for you
[02:14.70] Ooh, ooh
[02:21.04] Ooh it's true
[02:24.47] There's always room for you
[02:37.97] 
[02:28.97] When the odds of it all get in the way
[02:35.19] Know I'll be around when you call at the end of the day
[02:42.53] Even if the world around you feels like it's all falling apart
[02:47.19] There'll forever be a room for you inside of my heart
[02:51.18] It's true, there's always room for you
