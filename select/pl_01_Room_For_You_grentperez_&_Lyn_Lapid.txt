I've been meaning to call,
it's okay if you hate me
How's it like back at home?
Is the lake still as pretty?
I see that we've been
running around
In these peculiar
towns, different coastlines
And we've been way too
busy, it's cool
It's nice to see we're
still fools in the same light
When the odds of it all
get in the way
Know I'll be around when
you call at the end of the day
Even if the world around
it feels like it's all
falling apart
There'll forever be a room
for you inside of my heart
It's true, there's always
room for you, mm
About time that you rang,
here it's almost 10:30
(P.M.)
You just get out of bed,
you must've woken up early
Remember that old house down
the road with the window
you broke?
Well they tore it down
(Down, down, down, down)
And though the city's
starting to change
It still remembers your
name, like how I do now
When the odds of it all
get in the way
Know I'll be around when
you call at the end of the day
Even if the world around
it feels like it's all
falling apart
There'll forever be a room
for you inside of my heart
(Ooh)
It's true, there's always
room for you
(Ooh, ooh)
Ba-ba-dada, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ooh-ooh, ooh, it's true
There's always room for you
When the odds of it all
get in the way
Know I'll be around when
you call at the end of the day
Even if the world around
it feels like it's all
falling apart
There'll forever be a room
for you inside of my heart
It's true, there's always
room for you, mm
