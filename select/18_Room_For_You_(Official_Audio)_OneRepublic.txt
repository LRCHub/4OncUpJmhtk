Big love in a small house
Blue skies never run out
Don't you know that I always got room for you?
More time than we both need
Years pass and I won't leave
Honey, know that I always got room for you
Got room for you

I don't wanna know the future, don't need a crystal ball
I'm just chasing every bit of it down that hall
Just runnin' towards the light and see the world in bloom
Oh yeah
And she don't wanna be just a moment or just one glance
She don't wanna be the only one in this dance
Says all she needs is a little room

We've had good turn to bad
Days go from perfect to sad
Don't have the life that we planned
It's not the world wе knew

We got big love in a small housе
Blue skies never run out
Don't you know that I always got room for you? (Got room for you)
More time than we both need
Years pass and I won't leave
Honey, know that I always got room for you
Got room for you

I got room, I got room for you
Oh yeah
Everything that I do
I do for you

Take your time, take your time
None of the time comes back
She don't wanna trade the future for what she had
I don't wanna live it out any other way
And anything she says, she's not a liar (She's not a liar)
All the things I do, I can't deny 'em
And she was the first to turn my light on
And we may not have it all, ever have it all
But all I really know is, all I know is we got

Big love in a small house
Blue skies never run out
Don't you know that I always got room for you? (Got room for you)
More time than we both need
Years pass and I won't leave
Honey, know that I always got room for you
Got room for you

I got room, I got room for you
Oh yeah
Everything that I do
I do for you
I got room, I got room for you
Oh yeah

We got big love in a small house
Blue skies never run out
Honey, know that I always got room for you
