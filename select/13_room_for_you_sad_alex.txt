Sometimes I wake up, can't remember how to breathe
And I wish you were there with me
Sometimes I wake up, can't remember what I dream
But I hope it was you and me
Can't see your face without wanting it too
So far away but I keep room for you
Love ain't a place, it's the things that we do
And it's pulling me right back to you
I'm not okay
But I'll be just fine
Got days to waste
If it's you on my mind
I'm not afraid
I'll just follow the signs
They're pulling right back to you
Sometimes I wake up, can't remember how to breathe
And I wish you were there with me
Sometimes I wake up, can't remember what I dreamed
But I hope it was you and me
Can't see your face without wanting it too
So far away but I keep room for you
Love ain't a place, it's the things that we do
And it's pulling me right back to you
I was a mess, now I know what I want
That morning text, and you'll love till it's gone
If I could make, make it home in your arms
Holding me right next to you
Sometimes I wake up, can't remember how to breathe
And I wish you were there with me
Sometimes I wake up, can't remember what I dreamed
But I hope it was you and me, you and me
You and me
Hope it was you and me
Can't see your face without wanting it too
So far away but I keep room for you
So far away but I keep room for you
